**Dzenis Selmanovic Improvement**

**Improvement 1:**

**Current:**  There is no scroll to the top button on the page.

**Request:** Add scroll to the top button.

**Reason:**  For easier website usage and smoother navigation throughout the site, it's necessary to add this feature.


**Improvement 2:**

**Current:** There is no shopping cart on the page.

**Request:** Make it possible to add courses to the shopping cart. The shopping page should be in the navigation menu in the right corner. The shortcut to the add to cart button should be right next to the try course button

**Reason:** In the case that the customer wants to buy more than one course and it is not one of the packages that have already been made, he can choose which two or more courses he can buy at once. Also, add that in the case of purchasing two or more courses, the customer receives an additional discount. This is how we can increase the sale of courses.


**Improvement 3:**

**Current:** The Blog section is located in a barely visible place on the page.

**Request:** Put the Blog section on the main navigation menu.

**Reason:**  By adding this section in a more accessible place, we can attract and keep more visitors to our site who can get new information and stories related to IT. It can also help us if someone buys one of our courses.


**Improvement 4:**

**Current:** The size of the text in the navigation menu is small.

**Request:** Increase the size of the text and logo in the navigation menu. The size of the logo could be increased to 50px.

**Reason:**  For better visibility and a more professional appearance of the navigation bar, it is necessary to make the mentioned corrections.
